          <h1 class="headline"><b><br>Karl Rapp (1882-1962)</b></h1>
          <p class="intfounder">
            <br>
            Karl Rapp was a German engineer and entrepreneur who played a pivotal role in the early days of BMW.
            He founded the Rapp Motorenwerke company in 1913, which specialized in aircraft engines.
            Later, in 1916, Rapp merged his company with Gustav Otto's aircraft engine factory, forming Bayerische
            Motoren Werke AG, or BMW.
            While Rapp was instrumental in the company's early development, he eventually left BMW, and the company
            evolved into the world-renowned automobile manufacturer we know today.
            Rapp's contributions laid the foundation for BMW's future success in precision engineering and advanced
            technology.</p>
